# Cosmic Odyssey 🌌

Welcome to **Cosmic Odyssey**, a fun and educational project that combines science, philosophy, and a touch of humor to explore the mysteries of the universe! 🚀

---

## What is Cosmic Odyssey? 🤔

Cosmic Odyssey is a **Python-based desktop application** built with **PyQt6** that lets you dive into two fascinating topics:

1. **Intelligent Life Probability**:
   - Explore the probability of intelligent life existing in the universe over time.
   - Visualize how this probability changes from the Big Bang to the distant future when stars begin to die.

2. **Asteroid Collision Probability**:
   - Calculate the likelihood of an asteroid colliding with Earth over time.
   - Understand how small probabilities add up over millions of years.

## Why Cosmic Odyssey? 🌠

This project is both a **joke** and an **educational tool**:

- **It's a joke** because, let's be honest, who hasn't wondered about the meaning of life while staring at the stars? 🌌
- **It's educational** because it uses real scientific concepts (like probability and cosmology) to make you think about the universe and our place in it.

Whether you're a space enthusiast, a Python beginner, or just someone who loves to ponder the big questions, Cosmic Odyssey is for you!
